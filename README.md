Pixel Morph an image converter created with electron to allow you to convert any kind of BASE64 file to png, jpeg and webp. 
Some features are:

- Bulk convertion
- Drag-and-drop
- Beautiful design

Install from source
-------------------
You need to clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/Eneru2/pixel-morph

You will need [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download) in case you don't have it, and run the following commands:
  cd pixel-morph
  npm install
  npm run make
After that you will have the executable file corresponding to your OS and architecture.

Future of the project
--------------------
Right now I'm transitioning the project from Electron to [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) an alternative that is way lighter and is coded in Rust which will result in a more performant program.
